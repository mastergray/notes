ADB Setup:

	Device Setup ->

		Enable 'Developer Options' on android device:

			Go to Settings > About Phone
			Tap 'Build number' 7 times

		Enable 'USB debugging':

			Settings > Developer Options > USB debugging

	Terminal Setup ->

		Append $PATH to adb (view path with echo $PATH)

			export PATH=$PATH:{path to adb}
		
		example:

			export PATH=$PATH:/Users/{user}/Documents/android.dev/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20130917/sdk/platform-tools

		Add to ~/.bashrc to make change permanent (you may have to create this file, restart bash with {. .bashrc} for changes to take affect)

Quick and dirty way to set PATH for adb:

  1. Open                       -> nano ~/.bash_profile
  2. Paste in                   -> export PATH=$PATH:/Users/username/custompath/sdk/platform-tools/
  3. save file and reload file  -> source ~/.bash_profile
  4. test                       -> adb version

Basic Commands:

	adb devices                             ->  Show all attached devices ({serialNmber} {state})
	adb -s {command}                        ->  Issue commands to a specific device if multiple devices are attached
	adb install {fileName}.apk              ->  Install app to device (not necessary if using ADT)
	adb pull {device path} {terminal path}  ->  Copies a file or directory from device
	adb push {terminal path} {device path}  ->  Copies a file or directory to device
	adb shell                               ->  Invokes shell for adb
	adb shell {command}                     ->  Runs adb shell command with invoking adb shell
	adb -d logcat {.apk}:I *:S              ->  Shows logcat output for specific application running on device
	adb kill-server                         ->  Stops adb
	adb start-server                        ->  Starts adb

Connecting via wi-fi:

	adb tcpip {port number}
	adb connect {device ip}
