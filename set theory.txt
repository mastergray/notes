Set Theory

	Notation
	
		x e A => x is a member of A
		x !e A => x is not a member of A
		x c A => x is a subset of A
		x !c A => x is not a subset of A
		p * q => Logical AND
		p ^ q => Logical OR
		0 => an empty set (null)
		U => universal set (all sets of some specific discourse being investigated)

	Set Membership
	
		A = {x : condition} => the element x is a member of the set A if x is true for the given condition.

	Subsets

		A c B => If for every element in set A is also an element of set B, then A is a subset of B.
	
	Proper Subset
	
		A C B = If A is a subset of B, and A != B, then A is a proper subset of B.
	
	Disjoint Set
	
		A n B = 0 => If A and B have no sets in common, then A and B are disjoint (A n B = 0)
	
	Power Set
	
		P(A) => the set of all subsets for the set A
		
	Cardinality
	
		|A| => the number of elements in the set A.
		
	Operations

		Intersection => A n B = {x : x e A * x e B}
		Union => a u b = {x : x e A ^ x e B}
		Relative Difference = A \ B = {x : x e A * x !e B}
		Symmetric Difference = A @ B = {x :(x e A * x !e B) ^ (x e b * x e a)}
		Complement => A^c = {x : x !e A}
		Cartesian Product => A x B = {(x,y) : x e A * y e B}
	
	Ordered Pairs (Kuratowski definition)

		(x, y) = {{x}, {x,y}}, where A x B c P(P(A u B))
	
	Laws
					
		Commutative Laws => A u B = B u A
		                    A n B = B n A
		
		Associative Laws => A u (B u C) = (A u B) u C
		                    A n (B n C) = (A n B) n C

		Distributive Laws =  A u (B n C) = (A u B) n (A u C)
		                     A n (B u C) = (A n B) u (A n C)
		
		DeMorgan's Laws => (A u B)^c = A^c n B^c
		                   (A n B)^c = A^c u B^c
		
		Complement Laws => A u A^c = U
		                   A n A^c = 0
		                   U^c = 0
                       0^c = U
						   
		Double Complement => (A^c)^c = A
		
		Identity Laws => A u 0 = A
		                 A n U = A
		
		Idempotence => A u A = A
		               A n A = A
		
		Dominance => A n 0 = 0
		             A u U = U
						 
		Absorption Laws => A u (A n B) = A
		                   A n (A u B) = A
						   
	Theorems and Equivalences

		A c A => Every set is a subset of itself
		0 c A => Every set has an empty subset
		A \ B = A n B^c
		A @ B = (A u B) \ (A n B)
		|A u B| = |A| + |B|
 		|A^c| = |U| - |A|
		|A \ B| = |A| - |A n B|
		|A u B| = |A| + |B| - |A n B
		|P(A)| = 2^|A|
		A n (B \ A) = 0
		(A n B) u (A n B^c) = A
		A x B != B x A => Cartesian Product is a non-communitive operation
		
	Axioms

		Assertions
	
			I. "element" and "set" are undefined terms.
			II. "elements belong to a set" is an undefined relation.

		Principle of Extension => Two sets A and B are equal if and only if they have the same elements,
		                          that is, if every element of A belongs to B and every element of B belongs to A
		
		Principle Of Abstractions => Given any set U and any condition F, there is a set A such that the elements
		                             of A are exactly those elements in U which meet the condition of F; that is:
									 
		                             A = {x : x e U * F(x) is true}
